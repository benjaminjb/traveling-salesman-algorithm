### Traveling Salesman Algorithm, Branch-and-Bound Method

For the Eff Errands project (our first group hackathon), I attempted to write an algorithm that would find the shortest overall route for the errands. 

After some preliminary research into methods for solving the traveling salesman problem, I settled on the branch-and-bound method, which creates a tree-like decision structure that considers the shortest route with some path included vs. the shortest route with the same path excluded.

For instance, if the A-B distance is low, it might seem like a good route to take; a "greedy" algorithm that merely takes the shortest available path might take it. But using the A-B path (or edge if you prefer graph theory) might result in a sub-optimal choice for the overall route: A-B might be low, but the overall path might be higher if you include it. Branch-and-bound is meant to avoid the problem of greedy algorithms leading to suboptimal outcomes, while also operating slightly faster than a method that needs to check all of the edges between all of the nodes.

The algorithm proved a little too time-consuming in the time available for the hackathon, so we ended up using Google Maps API, which includes a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

For more on the branch-and-bound method, these were the resources I found most helpful:
